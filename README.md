### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JokingChicken/JokingChicken/master/wave_hand.gif" width="30px">

Hey! Thanks for checking me out.   

I am very intrested in programming in general:   
from games such as Minecraft (where I started and still work on today) to websites and discord bots!
  
  > Always working, just not on the things I should 🙃

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I work on many projects! It varies wildly depending on what I'm feeling. right now I am working on my website: [Axoid.net !](https://axoid.net)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm learning C++. but also still learning new things on JavaScript, typecript, CSharp and Java.  
Every time I learn something new I always find out there's so much more I don't know. I do plan on learning more languages! (like python and C)

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I have a chicken that is over 13 years old.  
And even though that is old for chickens, she is still teeming with life!!
