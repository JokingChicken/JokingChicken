### Hi there 👋

Hey! Thanks for checking me out.   
I am very intrested in programming in general: from Minecraft (where I started and still work on today) to websites and discord bots!

## 🛠️ projects:  
 - Nothing here yet?

Currently I have my projects on private.    
This is because I want to clean them up and make them perfect before I set them to Public.👌

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I work on many projects! It varies wildly depending on what I'm feeling. right now I am working on my website: [Axoid.net !!](https://axoid.net)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm learning C++. but also still working on JavaScript and Java.  
Every time I learn something new I always find out there's so much more I don't know. I do plan on learning more languages!

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I have chickens that are over 12 years old.  
And even though that is old for chickens, they are still teeming with life!!
