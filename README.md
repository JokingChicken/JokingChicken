Nothing here yet?

Currently I have my projects on private.\    
This is because I want to clean them up and make them perfect before I set them to Public.ðŸ‘Œ

Hey! Thanks for checking me out.\   
I am very intrested in programming in general: from Minecraft (where I started and still work on today) to websites and discord bots!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I work on many projects! It varies wildly depending on what I'm feeling. right now I am working on my website: [Axoid.net !!](https://axoid.net)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm learning C++. but also still working on JavaScript and Java.\  
Every time I learn something new I always find out there's so much more I don't know. I do plan on learning more languages!

## âš¡ Fun fact:

I have chickens that are over 12 years old.\  
And even though that is old for chickens, they are still teeming with life!!\
